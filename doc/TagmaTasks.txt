DESCRIPTION                                     *tagmatasks-description*

Displays tasks for the current buffer using the Vim |location-list| window.
Based on the task lists from other IDEs. Will also display marks next to each
task line using the Vim |signs| feature.

The Task List is generated using the |lvimgrep| command. See that command for
specifics on how the Task List is generated

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION                                    *tagmatasks-installation*

Copy the files to your ~/.vim or ~/vimfiles directory.
If using a package manager like pathogen place the whole directory in the
bundle directory.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                        *tagmatasks-commands*

Commands created for user use.

:TagmaTasks                                     *TagmaTasks*
        Generate the Task List.
        Depending on settings will:
            Display the task window, optionally jumping to the first task.
            Mark each line the task appears on.

:TagmaTaskMarks                                 *TagmaTaskMarks*
        Display the Task Marks.

:TagmaTaskClear                                 *TagmaTaskClear*

==============================================================================
MAPPINGS                                        *tagmatasks-mappings*

There are several global mappings for generating the Task List and controlling
the Task Marks. When the Task List is generated key mappings are also
generated for the buffer for jumping between tasks. See |tagmatasks-settings|
for information on controlling the key mappings.

Note:   The |Leader| key is normally set to "\".

<Leader>tt              |:TagmaTasks|
        Generate the Task List. Depending on settings will display the Task
        Window, jump to the first Task and mark the lines for each Task.

<Leader>tc              |:TagmaTaskClear|
        Clear the marks for each Task.

<Leader>tm              |:TagmaTaskMarks|
        Display the marks for each Task.

<Leader>tw
        Toggle the Task Window opened and closed.
        Note:   When the task window is closed the buffer is wiped.

The following mappings are defined in the buffers that Task Lists are
generated for.

[t                      |:lprevious|
        Jump to the previous Task.

]t                      |:lnext|
        Jump to the next Task.

[T                      |:lfirst|
        Jump to the first Task.

]T                      |:llast|
        Jump to the last Task.
